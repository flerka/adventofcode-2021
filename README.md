## Advent Of Code 2021 with C#

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of code 2021 ðŸŽ„](https://adventofcode.com/2021). All tasks are solved with **C#** and have unit tests to validate them.

I tried solving all tasks using only .Net 6 without external libraries. You can run any solution from the corresponding test. I made a point not to share any code between parts one and two. I tried to use new language features and a more functional approach, but with later tasks, but I wasn't always successful in it.
